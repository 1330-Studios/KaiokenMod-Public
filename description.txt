[quote=King Kai] "Oh... it's the Kaio-ken attack. It's like a massive upsurge of energy. Everything is heightened: power, speed, even hearing and vision improve dramatically. You sort of become a super-self. But it can only be sustained for a short time, so you have to get the job done quickly."[/quote]
[h1]Kaio-Ken Mod[/h1]
Kaio-ken is a technique invented by King Kai. It multiplies the user's ki for a "heartbeat" and turns their aura crimson - amplifying their power and speed to overcome previously stronger foes at the cost of extreme bodily recoil.

[h2]Mechanics[/h2]
By default, the keybinds are:
H - Transform / Detransform

Upon entering Kaio-ken. You lose all Health Regeneration and begin to generate Strain, representing your body pushing itself to its limits. 
At first there will be no adverse effect, but once your Strain reaches a certain threshold, it begins to burn and you begin to take unavoidable damage each second. 
The higher your Strain is, the higher your HP Loss is.

As you use Kaioken you slowly generate Mastery. Mastery increases how much Strain you have and thus how long you can remain in Kaio-Ken. 
Be aware, however, that your Mastery is capped based on which bosses you have successfully beaten in this world. 
If you want to reach the full potential of Kaio-Ken, you have to seek and fight tougher bosses.

Mastery also increases the bonus granted by Kaioken, as well as reducing the base HP drain before factoring in Strain calculations.
